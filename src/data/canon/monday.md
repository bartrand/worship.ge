**The refrains are sung after each troparion. At each refrain we make the sign of the cross and a full prostration.**

## Ode 1

_Tone 6_

**Irmos:** A helper and a protector, He has become my salvation. This is my God, I will glorify Him, my father’s God will I exalt, for gloriously has He been glorified.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Where shall I begin to lament the deeds of my wretched life? How shall I begin, O Christ, to relieve my present tears? But as Thou art deeply compassionate, grant me forgiveness of sins.

Come, O wretched soul, and together with thy body confess to the Creator of all so that henceforth, thou shalt abstain from thy past foolishness and offer tears of repentance to God.

Having rivaled the first-formed Adam by my transgressions, I have found myself stripped naked of God, of the everlasting kingdom and all of its delights, because of my sins.

Woe is me, O wretched soul, for thou art become like the first Eve! For thou hast looked in wickedness and wast bitterly wounded; for thou hast touched the tree and rashly tasted the forbidden fruit.

In the place of the physical Eve, the temptation of Eve hath taken flesh in my mind, showing me what seems to be sweet; but making me taste and swallow bitterness.

Adam was rightly banished from Eden, O Savior, because he disobeyed one of Thy commandments. What then shall I suffer, for constantly rejecting Thy words of life?


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O Trinity, Who surpasses all creation and is adored in Unity, take from me the heavy yoke of sin, and in Thy compassion grant me tears of compunction.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** O Theotokos, the hope and protection of those who praise thee, take from me the heavy yoke of sin and as thou art our Most-pure Lady, accept me in repentance.

## Ode 2

**Irmos:** Attend, O heaven and I will speak, I will sing of Christ, Who from the Virgin took flesh to dwell with us.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Attend, O heaven and I will speak; give ear, O earth to the voice of one who repents before God and sings His praises.

Look upon me, O God my Savior, with Thy merciful eye, and accept my fervent confession.

I have sinned above all men, I alone have sinned against Thee; but as God take pity on Thy creature, O Savior.

My lustful desires have formed in me the deformity of my passions and have disfigured the beauty of my mind.

A storm of passions surrounds me, O compassionate Lord. But stretch out Thine hand to me, as once Thou didst to Peter.

I have stained the garment of my flesh and have defiled that which was made in Thine image and likeness, O Savior.

I have darkened the beauty of my soul with passionate pleasures and have turned my whole mind entirely to dust.

I have torn the garment that the Creator first wove for me in the beginning, and therefore I lie naked.

I have clothed myself in the torn robe that the serpent hath spitefully stitched for me by his counsel, and now I am ashamed.

I offer to Thee, O merciful One, the tears of a harlot. Cleanse me, O Savior, in Thy compassion.

I looked upon the beauty of the forbidden tree and my mind was deceived; and now I lie naked and ashamed.

The demons of passion have ploughed long furrows on my back, prolonging their wickedness upon me.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** I sing praises to the One in Three Persons, God of all, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** O Most-pure Theotokos and All-laudable Virgin, fervently intercede for our salvation.

## Ode 3

**Irmos:** Establish Thy Church, O Christ, on the unshakable rock of Thy commandments.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

The Lord once rained fire from heaven and consumed the land of Sodom.

Seek salvation on the mountain as did Lot, O my soul, and find thy refuge in Zoar.

Flee from the flames, O my soul, flee from the burning heat of Sodom, flee the destruction of the divine fire.

I alone have sinned against Thee, I have sinned above all men; reject me not, O Christ my Savior.

Thou art the Good Shepherd: seek me, the lamb that has gone astray and do not forsake me.

Thou art my sweet Jesus, Thou art my Creator, and in Thee shall I be justified, O Savior.

I confess that I have sinned, I have sinned against Thee, O Savior. But in Thy compassion absolve me and forgive me.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O God, the Trinity, One in Unity, save us from delusion and temptation and distress.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** Rejoice, O Womb that bore Divinity! Rejoice, O Throne of the Lord! Rejoice, O Mother of our Life!

## Ode 4

**Irmos:** The prophet heard of Thy coming, O Lord, and was afraid that Thou wast to be born of a Virgin and appear to men, and he said, ‘I have heard the report of Thee and am afraid.’ Glory to Thy power, O Lord.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Despise not Thy works, O Righteous Judge, and forsake not Thy creation though I alone have sinned more than any other man. Yet Thou, as the Lord of all, hast the power to remit all sins, O Lover of mankind.

The end draws near, O my soul, the end draws near; yet thou dost not prepare, neither dost thou care. The time grows short. Arise, for the Judge is at the very doors. The days of our lives pass quickly, as if they were a dream, as if they were a flower. O why do we trouble ourselves in vain?

Arise, O my soul and consider all the deeds which thou hast done, and set them up before thine eyes. Now pour out the drops of thy tears and boldly confess to Christ of thy deeds and thoughts, and so be thou justified.

In life’s course, O Savior, there has been no sin, no deed, no wicked thing, that I did not commit. I have sinned as no one has ever before, in mind, word and intent, in purpose, deed and thought.

For this I am condemned and for this, wretch that I am, I am convicted by mine own conscience, more severe than all else in the world. O my Judge and Redeemer, Who knowest my heart, spare me, deliver me and save me, Thy servant.

The ladder seen of old by the great Patriarch Jacob is an example, O my soul, both of ascent through action and of ascent through spiritual understanding. If, therefore, it is thy desire to live by thy works, with understanding and contemplation, be thou made new.

Bearing the burning heat by day and the frost by night because of his privation, Jacob endured making daily gains, shepherding, struggling and slaving in order to win two wives.

By the two wives, understand that one is action and the other is spiritual understanding in contemplation. Leah represents action, for she had many children; and Rachel spiritual understanding, for she endured great toil. For without labor, O my soul, neither action nor contemplation will succeed.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** I confess Thee as undivided in Essence, unconfused in Persons, One Triune Divinity, co-reigning and co-enthroned! And to Thee, I raise the great Thrice-holy hymn that is sung on high.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** Thou givest birth and art a virgin, and in both thou remainest a virgin by nature. He Who is born renews the laws of nature, and the womb gives birth without travail. When God so wills, the order of nature is overruled, for He does whatsoever He wills.

## Ode 5

**Irmos:** Out of the night watching early for Thee, enlighten me I pray, O Lover of man, and guide me in Thy commandments and teach me O Savior, to do Thy will.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

The whole of my life has passed by in the night, for the darkness of sin has covered me like a thick fog in the middle of the night. But make me a son of the day, O Savior.

Imitating Rueben, I have devised a wicked and lawless act against God Most High, having defiled my bed as he defiled the bed of his father.

I confess to Thee, O Christ my King, that I have sinned. I have sinned like the brothers of Joseph of old, who sold the fruit of purity and chastity.

His righteous and gentle soul was bound by his kinsmen and he was sold into slavery as a foretelling of the Lord. But thou, O my soul, hast sold thyself entirely to thy sins.

O my miserable and wretched soul, imitate the righteous and chaste mind of Joseph; and do not defile thyself by continuing to indulge thy wanton and irrational desires.

When Joseph was cast down into the pit, O Lord and Master, it was to prefigure Thy Burial and Resurrection. But what offering such as this shall I ever make to Thee?


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** We glorify Thee, O Trinity, as One God! Holy, Holy, Holy, art Thou, Father, Son and Holy Spirit; simple Essence and Unity worshipped for ever.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** From thee, O Virgin undefiled and maiden Mother, has God the Creator of the ages, become vested in my human flesh, uniting to Himself the nature of man.

## Ode 6

**Irmos:** With my whole heart, I cried unto the compassionate God: and He heard me, and He lifted up my soul from the depths of hell and from corruption.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

I offer to Thee in purity the tears of mine eyes and the sighs from the depth of my heart, which cries: I have sinned against Thee, O God, have mercy on me.

Thou hast turned thyself away from thy Lord, O my soul, as did Dathan and Abiram; but cry out from the lowest depths of hell: ‘Spare me’, that the earth may not open up and swallow thee.

Do not be like Ephraim stung to madness like a stampeding calf, O my soul, but rather, save thy life like a gazelle fleeing from the snare on the wings of action, resolve and contemplation.

Let the hand of Moses assure us, O my soul, that God can cleanse and make again as white as snow a leprous life. So do not despair, though thou thyself art leprous.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** ‘I am the Trinity, simple and undivided, yet divided in Three Persons; and I am the Unity, united by Nature’, says the Father and the Son and the Divine Spirit.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** Thy womb bore God for us, fashioned in our image. Implore thou Him as the Creator of all, O Theotokos, that we may be justified through thine intercessions.

Kontakion (TONE 6): My soul, my soul arise! Why art thou sleeping? The end is drawing near and thou wilt be confounded. Awake then and be watchful, that thou mayest be spared by Christ God, Who is everywhere and fillest all things.

## Ode 7

**Irmos:** We have sinned, transgressed, done wrong before Thee. We have not watched or done as Thou hast commanded us. But do not give us up utterly, O God of our fathers.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

I have sinned, I have transgressed, and I have rejected Thy commandments, for in sins have I progressed and have added sores to my wounds. But in Thy compassion have mercy on me, O God of our fathers.

I have confessed to Thee the secrets of my heart, O my Judge. See my humility and behold my affliction, and consider now my condemnation. But in Thy compassion have mercy on me, O God of our fathers.

Once, when Saul went searching for his father’s lost herds he found himself proclaimed as king. Be watchful, O my soul, lest while searching for thine animal desires thou shouldst overlook the Kingdom of Christ.

David, the forefather of God, once sinned doubly, O my soul; being pierced with the arrow of adultery and struck with the spear of murder’s remorse. But thou, my soul, art more gravely ill than he, for worse than any acts are the urgings of thy will.

David once joined sin to sin when he mixed adultery with murder; yet then he showed at once a twofold repentance. But thou, my soul, hast done worse things than he, yet thou hast not repented before God.

David once composed a hymn, setting forth, as in an icon, all the evils he had done; and he condemned them, crying, ‘Have mercy on me, for against Thee only have I sinned, O God of all, cleanse me!’


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O Trinity, simple and undivided, consubstantial and of One Nature. We praise Thee, Light and Lights, One Holy and Three Holies, God the Trinity! Sing, O my soul, and glorify the Life of Lives, the God of all.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

I have sinned, O Savior, have mercy on me. Awaken my mind to conversion, accept my repentance and take pity on me as I cry: Against Thee only have I sinned and have done evil in Thy sight, have mercy on me.

Elijah once ascended above all earthly things in the chariot of his virtues as if to Heaven. Meditate, then O my soul, on this ascent.

Elisha once took up the mantle of Elijah and received a double portion of grace from the Lord. But thou, O my soul, hast no share in this grace because of thine uncontrolled desires.

With the mantle of Elijah, Elisha made the streams of the Jordan stand still on either side. But thou, O my soul, hast no share in this grace because of thine uncontrolled desires.

The Shunammite woman graciously gave shelter to the righteous man, but thou, O my soul, hast welcomed neither stranger nor traveler into thy house. Therefore shalt thou be cast out weeping from the bridal chamber.

In all ways hast thou imitated the unclean thoughts of Gehazi, O my wretched soul. At least now, in thine old age, rid thyself of his greed and flee from the fires of hell, turning away from thine evil ways.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O Eternal Father, Co-eternal Son and Gracious Comforter, the Spirit of Righteousness, Father of the Divine Word, Word of the Eternal Father, and Living and Creating Spirit. O Trinity, One in Unity, have mercy on me!

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** The spiritual purple of Emmanuel was woven inside thy womb as if from scarlet silk, O Most-pure Virgin. Therefore we honor thee as truly Theotokos.

## Ode 9

**Irmos:** Ineffable is the childbearing of a seedless conception; a mother remaining pure. For the birth of God renews nature’s birth; so in all ages we magnify thee in an Orthodox manner as the Mother and Bride of God.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

My mind is wounded, my body is feeble, my spirit is sick, my speech has lost its power, my life is ebbing, and the end is at the door. What shalt thou do, O miserable soul, when the Judge comes to examine thy deeds?

I have reviewed for thee, O my soul, Moses’ account of the creation of the world, and then all of the canonical Scripture that tells the story of both the righteous and the wicked. But thou, my soul, hast followed the ways of the wicked and hast sinned against God.

The Law is grown weak, the Gospel unpracticed, and the whole of Scripture is ignored by thee; the Prophets fail and the words of the righteous are useless. Thy wounds, O soul, have multiplied, and there is no physician to heal thee.

I will now show thee, O my soul, examples from the New Testament, to lead thee to repentance. Follow the example of the righteous and avoid following the ways of the sinners and strive to regain the grace of Christ through prayer and fasting, purity and reverence.

Christ became man, calling thieves and harlots to repentance. Repent then, O my soul! For the doors of the Kingdom are already opened and the Publicans and penitent Pharisees and adulterers pass through before thee.

Christ became man by assuming my flesh and He willingly experienced all that belongs to our nature apart from our sin. Thus, He set before thee, O my soul, an example and image of His own condescension.

Christ saved the Magi, called the Shepherds, transformed a host of infants into Martyrs and glorified the Elders and the aged Widows, whose lives and deeds thou hast chosen to ignore, O my soul. But woe unto thee when the time of thy Judgement comes!

When the Lord had fasted for forty days in the wilderness, He became hungry thus showing us His human nature. Do not be dismayed, O my soul, and when the enemy attacks thee, drive him away through prayer and fasting.

_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** Let us glorify the Father, let us exalt the Son and with faith let us worship the Divine and Holy Spirit, the Trinity undivided, Unity in Essence; Light of Lights, Life and Lives, giving light and life to the ends of the earth.

**Theotokion:** Protect this, thy habitation, O Most-pure Mother of God, for through thee she reigns in faith, by thee she is made strong, by thee she is made victorious defeating every trial and temptation, despoiling every enemy and ruling over her obedient servants.

_Venerable Father Andrew, pray to God for us._

**To Saint Andrew:** O Venerable and Thrice-blessèd Father Andrew, the shepherd of Crete; cease not to offer thy prayers for us who sing thy praises; that we may be delivered from every danger and affliction, from corruption and sin, who honor thy memory with faith.

**Katavasia, Irmos 9:** Ineffable is the childbearing of a seedless conception; a mother remaining pure. For the birth of God renews nature’s birth; so in all ages we magnify thee in an Orthodox manner as the Mother and Bride of God.
