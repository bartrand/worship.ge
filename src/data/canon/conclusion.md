## The Prayer of St. Ephrem

O Lord and Master of my life, give me not a spirit of sloth, despair, lust off power, and idle talk. **(Prostration)**
But give rather a spirit of chastity, humility, patience, and love to thy servant. **(Prostration)**
Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own transgressions, and not to judge my brother; for blessed art thou unto ages of ages. Amen. **(Prostration)**

## Small Compline (resumed)

### Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression.

Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.

Against thee only have I sinned, and done what is evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified in thy words, and prevail when thou art judged.

For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me.

For, behold, thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of thy wisdom hast thou made known unto me.

Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.

Thou shalt cause me to hear joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled shall rejoice.

Turn thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.

Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and establish me with a governing spirit.

I will teach transgressors thy ways, and the ungodly shall return unto thee.

Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall rejoice in thy righteousness.

O Lord, thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have given it; thou wilt not be pleased with whole burnt offerings.

A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.

Do good, O Lord, in thy good pleasure unto Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be built.

Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole burnt offerings.

Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

### Psalm 142

Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear to my supplication in thy truth; hearken unto me in thy righteousness.

And enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has humbled my life down to the ground; he has set me in dark places, like those long dead.

And my spirit was despondent within me; my heart within me was troubled.

I remembered days of old; I meditated on all thy deeds; on the works of thy hands did I meditate.

I spread forth my hands unto thee; my soul thirsts for thee like a waterless land.

Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit has failed; turn not thy face away from me, lest I become like those that go down to the pit.

Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in thee; make known to me, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for I have lifted my soul up to thee.

Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord, for I have fled unto thee for refuge.

Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.

Thy good Spirit shall guide me in the land of uprightness.

Thou shalt quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name’s sake; in thy righteousness thou shalt bring my soul out of affliction.

And in thy mercy thou wilt lay waste mine enemies; and thou wilt destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I am thy servant. 

### The Lesser Doxology

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men. 

We praise Thee, we bless Thee, we worship Thee, we glorify Thee, we give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory. O Lord, heavenly King, God the Father Almighty. O Lord, the Only-Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.

O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, Who takest away the sin of the world, have mercy on us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of the Father have mercy on us. For Thou alone art holy, Thou alone art Lord, Jesus Christ, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.

Every night will I give thanks to Thee and praise Thy Name for ever and ever.

Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation. I said: Lord, have mercy on me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee. Lord, I have fled unto Thee. Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God. For with Thee is the fountain of life, and in Thy light shall we see light. O continue Thy mercy unto those who know Thee.

Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this night without sin. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and praised and glorified is Thy Name forever. Amen. Let Thy mercy be upon us, O Lord, as we have set our hope on Thee. 

Blessed art Thou, O Lord, teach me Thy statutes. Blessed art Thou, O Master, make me to understand Thy commandments. Blessed art Thou, O Holy One, enlighten me with Thy precepts. 

Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth forever: despise not the works of Thy hands.

To Thee belongeth worship, to Thee belongeth praise, to Thee belongeth glory: to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.

### The Symbol of Faith
I believe in one God, the Father almighty; Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-Begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages. Light of Light, true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end.

And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke by the Prophets.

In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

### It Is Truly Meet

It is truly meet to bless thee, O Theotokos, ever-blessed and most pure and the Mother of our God. More honorable than the Cherubim, and more glorious beyond compare than the Seraphim, without corruption thou gavest birth to God the Word: true Theotokos, we magnify thee.

### The Lord's Prayer

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name; Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
**Priest:** For Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages.
Amen.


O God of our fathers, Who at all times showest loving-kindness to us, take not Thy mercy away from us, but through the prayers of Thy saints guide our lives in peace.

As with fine porphyry and royal purple, Thy Church has been adorned with Thy martyrs’ blood shed throughout all the world. She cries to Thee, O Christ God: “Send down Thy bounties on Thy people, grant peace to Thy habitation and great mercy to our souls!”


Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. 

With the saints give rest, O Christ, to the souls of Thy servants, where there is neither sickness nor sorrow, and no more sighing, but life everlasting!

Now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.

Thou Who at every season and every hour, in Heaven and on earth, art worshipped and glorified, O Christ our God, long-suffering, merciful and compassionate; Who lovest the just and showest mercy upon the sinner; Who callest all men to salvation through the promise of blessings to come: O Lord, in this hour receive our supplications and direct our lives according to Thy commandments. 

Sanctify our souls, hallow our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our minds; deliver us from all tribulations, evil, and distress.

Amen.

### A Prayer to the Most Holy Theotokos

O spotless, undefiled, incorrupt, immaculate, and pure Virgin; Queen of heaven and Bride of God; who through thy most glorious birthgiving hast united God the Word to men, and hast joined the outcast nature of our race to heavenly things; who alone art the hope of the hopeless, the help of the embattled, the ready protector of those who flee unto thee, and the refuge of all Christians:

Do not abhor me, a wretched sinner, even though I have made myself altogether useless through shameful thoughts, words, and deeds, and through my laziness in understanding have become a slave to the pleasures of this life.

Inasmuch as thou art the Mother of the God Who loves mankind, show thy loving-kindness toward me, a sinner and prodigal, and accept my prayer, though it be offered unto thee from defiled lips.

And making use of thy boldness as a Mother, pray to thy Son, our Master and Lord, that He open even unto me the goodness and compassions of His heart and turn me to repentance, overlooking my countless transgressions and revealing me to be a skillful doer of His commandments.

And since thou art full of mercy, loving-kindness, and tenderness, in this present life stand by me always; and as my fervent intercessor and helper, drive away the assaults of enemies and guide me toward salvation.

At the time of my exodus from this life, take care for my wretched soul and drive far from it the dark forms of evil demons; and on the fearful Day of Judgment, deliver me from eternal torments and show me to be an heir of the ineffable glory of thy Son and our God.

May I obtain all this, my Lady, most holy Theotokos, through thy mediation and protection: through the grace and love for mankind of thine Only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Savior Jesus Christ, to Whom is due all glory, honor, and worship, together with His Father Who is without beginning, and His all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.

### A Prayer to Our Lord Jesus Christ

And grant, O Master, when we go to sleep, repose of body and soul, and keep us from the gloomy slumber of sin and from every dark and passionate pleasure of the night.

Calm the impulses of the passions; quench the flaming arrows of the evil one that are craftily loosed against us.

Still the rebellions of our flesh and lull to sleep all our earthly and material reasonings.

And grant us, O God, a watchful mind, chaste thoughts, a sober heart, and a tranquil sleep, free of every fantasy of Satan.

Raise us up at the time of prayer confirmed in Thy commandments and with the memory of Thy judgments held firmly within us.

Grant that we may offer Thee glory all through the night, and that we may sing and bless and glorify Thy most honorable and majestic Name: of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.

Most glorious, ever-virgin Mother of Christ our God, present our prayer to thy Son and our God, that through thee He may save our souls.


My hope is the Father. My refuge is the Son. My protection is the Holy Spirit. O Holy Trinity, glory to Thee.


**Priest:** Glory to Thee, O Christ our God and our hope, glory to Thee.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen. Lord, have mercy (thrice). Father, bless.


**Priest:** May Christ our true God, through the prayers of His most pure Mother, of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers, and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and loves mankind.


**And immediately the priest, still facing the people, bows and says:** Bless, holy fathers and brethren, and forgive me a sinner all wherein I have sinned this day in deed, word, and thought, and by all my senses.

**The people respond:**

May God forgive and have mercy on thee, holy father. And bowing, they say: Bless me, holy father, and forgive all wherein I have sinned this day in deed, word, and thought, and by all my senses, and pray for me a sinner.

**And the priest:**

Through His grace, may God forgive and have mercy on us all.
