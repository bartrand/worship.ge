## The Prayer of St. Ephrem

O Lord and Master of my life, give me not a spirit of sloth, despair, lust off power, and idle talk. **(Prostration)**
But give rather a spirit of chastity, humility, patience, and love to thy servant. **(Prostration)**
Yea, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own transgressions, and not to judge my brother; for blessed art thou unto ages of ages. Amen. **(Prostration)**

### Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression.

Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.

Against thee only have I sinned, and done what is evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified in thy words, and prevail when thou art judged.

For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me.

For, behold, thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of thy wisdom hast thou made known unto me.

Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.

Thou shalt cause me to hear joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled shall rejoice.

Turn thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.

Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and establish me with a governing spirit.

I will teach transgressors thy ways, and the ungodly shall return unto thee.

Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall rejoice in thy righteousness.

O Lord, thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have given it; thou wilt not be pleased with whole burnt offerings.

A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.

Do good, O Lord, in thy good pleasure unto Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be built.

Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole burnt offerings.

Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

### Psalm 142

Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear to my supplication in thy truth; hearken unto me in thy righteousness.

And enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has humbled my life down to the ground; he has set me in dark places, like those long dead.

And my spirit was despondent within me; my heart within me was troubled.

I remembered days of old; I meditated on all thy deeds; on the works of thy hands did I meditate.

I spread forth my hands unto thee; my soul thirsts for thee like a waterless land.

Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit has failed; turn not thy face away from me, lest I become like those that go down to the pit.

Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in thee; make known to me, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for I have lifted my soul up to thee.

Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord, for I have fled unto thee for refuge.

Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.

Thy good Spirit shall guide me in the land of uprightness.

Thou shalt quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name’s sake; in thy righteousness thou shalt bring my soul out of affliction.

And in thy mercy thou wilt lay waste mine enemies; and thou wilt destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I am thy servant.
