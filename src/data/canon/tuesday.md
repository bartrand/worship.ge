## Ode 1

**Irmos:** A helper and a protector, He has become my salvation. This is my God, I will glorify Him, my father’s God will I exalt, for gloriously has He been glorified.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Of mine own free will have I incurred Cain’s guilt of murder; for I have murdered my own conscience by cultivating my flesh and making war upon my soul’s awareness by my wicked actions. 

I have refused to imitate Abel’s righteousness, O Jesus: never have I offered Thee any acceptable gift or godly work; neither a pure sacrifice nor a blameless life.

Like Cain, we are condemned, O wretched soul, for we have offered to the Creator of all only our defiled actions, a polluted sacrifice and a useless life.

As a potter molds his clay, Thou hast fashioned my flesh and my bones, giving me breath and life. Now accept me in repentance, O my Maker and Redeemer and my Judge.

I confess to Thee, O Savior, all the sins I have committed and the wounds of my soul and body, which my murderous thoughts, like thieves, have inflicted upon me.

Though I have sinned, O Savior, yet I know that Thou art the Lover of mankind. Thou dost chastise with mercy and art fervent in compassion. Thou dost see my tears and Thou dost run to meet me, like the Father toward his Prodigal Son.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O Trinity, Who surpasses all creation and is adored in Unity, take from me the heavy yoke of sin, and in Thy compassion grant me tears of compunction.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** O Theotokos, the hope and protection of those who praise thee, take from me the heavy yoke of sin and as thou art our Most-pure Lady, accept me in repentance.

## Ode 2

**Irmos:** Attend, O heaven and I will speak, I will sing of Christ, Who from the Virgin took flesh to dwell with us.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

My sins have stripped me of the garment that God had woven for me, and have stitched for me robes of skin.

Now I am clothed with a raiment of shame as if with fig leaves in reproof of my self-willed desires.

Now I am clad in a coat of disgrace that is shamefully bloodstained by the flow of my passions and my pleasure-loving life.

I have fallen under the burden of my passions and the corruption of my body, and ever since, have been oppressed by the enemy.

Having preferred a life of pleasure and material things to a life free of possessions, I have been harnessed with a heavy burden, O Savior.

I have adorned the idol of my flesh with the diverse clothing of my shameful thoughts and now I am condemned.

I have been concerned only with outward adornment, and have neglected the inner temple made in the image of God.

I have buried the beauty of my original image with my passions, O Savior; but seek me, as once Thou hast sought the lost coin, and find me.

Like the Harlot I cry to Thee: I have sinned, I alone have sinned against Thee. Oh, accept my tears as a sweet ointment, O Savior.

Like the Publican I cry to Thee: Be merciful, O Savior, be merciful unto me; for no child of Adam has ever sinned as I against Thee.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** I sing praises to the One in Three Persons, God of all, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** O Most-pure Theotokos and All-laudable Virgin, fervently intercede for our salvation.

## Ode 3

**Irmos:** Establish, O Lord, my unstable heart on the rock of Thy commandments, for Thou only art Holy and the Lord.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

In Thee I have found the Fountain of Life, O Conqueror of Death, and before the end, I cry out from my heart: I have sinned, O Lord, cleanse me and save me.

I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned against Thee; be gracious unto me and cleanse me, for there is no one who surpasses me in my offenses.

I have imitated the example of those, O Savior, who lived in wantonness in the days of Noah; and like them I am condemned to drown in the Flood.

Thou hast followed the example of Ham, O my soul, who mocked his father; for thou hast not covered the disgrace of thy neighbor keeping thy face turned away.

Flee like Lot, O my soul, from the burning of sin; flee from Sodom and Gomorrah; flee from the flames of wanton desire.

Have mercy, O Lord, have mercy on me, when Thou comest with Thine Angels to reward each according to his deeds, have mercy on me.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O simple Unity praised in a Trinity of Persons; O uncreated Nature without beginning, save us who in faith worship Thy power.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** O Virgin Theotokos, thou hast given birth within time to the timeless Son of the Father. O strange wonder! Thou givest Him milk while still remaining Virgin!

## Ode 4

**Irmos:** The prophet heard of Thy coming, O Lord, and was afraid that Thou wast to be born of a Virgin and appear to men, and he said, ‘I have heard the report of Thee and am afraid.’ Glory to Thy power, O Lord.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Watch, O my soul, and take courage like the Great Patriarch Jacob of old, that thou mayest acquire action with spiritual understanding, and be named Israel, ‘the mind that sees God’; and so shalt thou penetrate the impassable darkness through contemplation, and obtain a great treasure as thy reward.

By fathering the twelve Patriarchs, the Great Patriarch Jacob established a mystical ladder of active ascent for thee, O my soul; wisely setting his sons as the steps at each level of ascent.

Thou hast rivaled the hated Esau, O my soul, for thou hast given up the birthright of thy first beauty to the deceiver thus forsaking thy father’s blessing. Twice then, hast thou fallen, once in action and once in understanding; Repent now, thou wretched soul.

Esau was known as Edom because of his raging love for women; for burning always with desires and stained with sensual pleasures, he was named ‘Edom’ which means the red-hot heat of a sin-loving soul.

Thou hast heard of Job, O my soul, who was justified on a dung heap; yet thou hast not imitated his courage nor hast thou shown any firmness of will in the face of thy trials and temptations but hast proved cowardly and weak.

He that once sat upon a throne now lies naked on a dung heap, covered with his sores. He that had many children and was once admired by all is suddenly bereft of children and is left without a home; yet for him the dung heap is a palace, and his sores a chain of pearls.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** I confess Thee as undivided in Essence, unconfused in Persons, One Triune Divinity, co-reigning and co-enthroned! And to Thee, I raise the great Thrice-holy hymn that is sung on high.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** Thou givest birth and art a virgin, and in both thou remainest a virgin by nature. He Who is born renews the laws of nature, and the womb gives birth without travail. When God so wills, the order of nature is overruled, for He does whatsoever He wills.

## Ode 5

**Irmos:** Out of the night watching early for Thee, enlighten me I pray, O Lover of man, and guide me in Thy commandments and teach me O Savior, to do Thy will.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Thou hast heard, O my soul, of the basket of Moses and how he was carried on the waves of the river as if in an ark; and so he avoided the execution of Pharaoh’s bitter decree.

Thou hast heard, O wretched soul, of the midwives who were ordered to put to death in infancy the fruit of manly chastity. Be then like Moses who survived, and ponder wisdom.

Thou, O wretched soul, hast not struck and killed the lustful mind of the Egyptian, as did Moses. How then, shalt thou dwell in that desert where all passions are slain through repentance?

Moses the great went to dwell in the desert; Come then, O my soul, and emulate his life that thou mayest also behold through contemplation, the vision of God in the bush not consumed by the fire.

Imagine, O my soul, the rod of Moses, which divided the sea and dried up the abyss as an image of the Divine and Holy Cross. Through the Cross thou canst also accomplish great things.

While Aaron offered to God a fire that was pure and undefiled, Hophni and Phineas brought to Him, as didst thou, O my soul, a strange sacrifice and a polluted life.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** We glorify Thee, O Trinity, as One God! Holy, Holy, Holy, art Thou, Father, Son and Holy Spirit; simple Essence and Unity worshipped for ever.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** From thee, O Virgin undefiled and maiden Mother, has God the Creator of the ages, become vested in my human flesh, uniting to Himself the nature of man.

## Ode 6

**Irmos:** With my whole heart, I cried unto the compassionate God: and He heard me, and He lifted up my soul from the depths of hell and from corruption.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

The waves of my sins, O Savior, have returned and have suddenly overwhelmed me, as the waters of the Red Sea engulfed the Egyptians of old and their charioteers.

Like the Israelites in the desert, thou hast made a foolish decision, O my soul; for thou hast preferred the pleasures of gluttony and passions to the refreshment of divine manna.

Thou hast preferred, O my soul, the wells of delusion to the cleft Rock from which, as from a chalice, flow rivers of divine theology.

Thou hast preferred, O my soul, the meat of swine and the tempting food of Egypt to the food of Heaven, as did the ungrateful people of old in the wilderness.

When Thy servant Moses struck the rock with his staff, O Savior, he mystically foreshadowed Thy Life-creating Body from which we all draw the water of life.

Be like Joshua, the son of Nun, and explore the Promised Land, O my soul, and take up thine abOde in it through obedience to the Law.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** ‘I am the Trinity, simple and undivided, yet divided in Three Persons; and I am the Unity, united by Nature’, says the Father and the Son and the Divine Spirit.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** Thy womb bore God for us, fashioned in our image. Implore thou Him as the Creator of all, O Theotokos, that we may be justified through thine intercessions.

**Kontakion:** My soul, my soul arise! Why art thou sleeping? The end is drawing near and thou wilt be confounded. Awake then and be watchful, that thou mayest be spared by Christ God, Who is everywhere and fillest all things.

## Ode 7

**Irmos:** We have sinned, transgressed, done wrong before Thee. We have not watched or done as Thou hast commanded us. But do not give us up utterly, O God of our fathers.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

When the Ark of the Covenant was being carried in a cart and one of the oxen stumbled, Uzzah only touched it, and yet he experienced the wrath of God. Flee from his presumption, O my soul, and respect with reverence the things of God.

Thou hast heard of Absalom, and how he rebelled against nature; thou knowest of his wicked deeds and how he defiled his father David’s bed; yet thou hast followed him in his passionate and sensual desires.

Thy free dignity hast thou enslaved to thy body. O my soul, for thou hast found in the enemy another Ahithophel and hast become an accomplice to his designs. But Christ Himself has shattered his bonds so that thou mayest be saved.

Solomon the wonderful was full of grace and wisdom, yet he too, committed evil in the sight of Heaven and turned away from God; and thou, my wretched soul, have followed him, by thine accursèd life.

Carried away by his sensual passions, he defiled himself, Alas! Solomon the lover of wisdom became a lover of harlots and estranged himself from God. And thou, my soul hath imitated him through thy shameful desires.

Thou hast taken the example, O my soul, of Rehoboam who would not listen to his father’s counselors, and of Jeroboam, that evil and apostate servant. But flee from their example and cry aloud: I have sinned, O God, take pity on me.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O Trinity, simple and undivided, consubstantial and of One Nature. We praise Thee, Light and Lights, One Holy and Three Holies, God the Trinity! Sing, O my soul, and glorify the Life of Lives, the God of all.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** We praise thee, we bless thee, we venerate thee, O Mother of God: for thou hast given birth to Christ God, One of the undivided Trinity, and hast opened the Heavens to us on earth.

## Ode 8

**Irmos:** Him whom the hosts of heaven glorify, whom the Cherubim and Seraphim dread, let every breath and creature praise, bless and magnify throughout all ages.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Having imitated Uzziah, O my soul, thou hast contracted a double leprosy: for thy deeds are wicked and thy thoughts, impure. Leave these all behind, and hasten to repentance.

Thou hast heard of the Ninevites, O my soul, who repented before God wearing sackcloth and ashes; yet thou hast not imitated them and hast become worse than all who have ever sinned both before and after the Law.

Thou hast heard, O my soul, how Jeremiah in the muddy pit cried out with lamentations and sought tears for the city of Sion. Imitate his life of lamentation, therefore, and be saved.

Jonah fled to Tarshish foreseeing the conversion of the Ninevites, for as a Prophet he knew of God’s compassion and was anxious that his prophecy be fulfilled.

Thou hast heard, O my soul, how Daniel stopped the mouths of the lions in the pit; and how the Three Youths quenched the fiery flames of the furnace through faith.

I have set before thee the names of people from the Old Testament to serve as examples, O my soul. Imitate the God-pleasing deeds of the Righteous, and flee from the sins of the wicked.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** O Eternal Father, Co-eternal Son and Gracious Comforter, the Spirit of Righteousness, Father of the Divine Word, Word of the Eternal Father, and Living and Creating Spirit. O Trinity, One in Unity, have mercy on me!

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** The spiritual purple of Emmanuel was woven inside thy womb as if from scarlet silk, O Most-pure Virgin. Therefore we honor thee as truly Theotokos.

## Ode 9

**Irmos:** Ineffable is the childbearing of a seedless conception; a mother remaining pure. For the birth of God renews nature’s birth; so in all ages we magnify thee in an Orthodox manner as the Mother and Bride of God.

**Refrain:** _Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me._

### Troparia

Christ suffered temptation, being tempted by the devil, who showed Him stones that they might be made into bread; and he led Him up into a mountain to see in an instant, all the kingdoms of the world. Be careful, O my soul, when thou art tempted; be watchful and pray every hour to Christ our God.

The Forerunner of God, the Dove of the desert, the Lamp of Christ, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, was heard preaching repentance while Herod was lying in sin with Herodias. Be careful, O my soul, that thou art not trapped in the snares of the wicked, but rather, embrace repentance.

The Forerunner of Grace went to dwell in the wilderness, and all of Judea and Samaria ran to hear him; they confessed all their sins and eagerly they were baptized. But thou, O my soul, hast not imitated them.

Marriage is an honorable estate, and the marriage bed is undefiled, for Christ blessed both: by eating at the wedding feast in Cana and by turning the water into wine thus revealing His first miracle, so that thou, O my soul, might be transformed.

Christ cured the paralytic who then took up his bed; He raised from the dead the widow’s son and the Centurion’s servant; He appeared to the Samaritan woman and taught thee, O my soul, how to worship in the spirit.

By the touch of the hem of His garment the Lord healed the woman with the issue of blood; He cleansed the lepers, gave sight to the blind and made the lame to walk; with His word He cured the deaf and the dumb and the woman who was bent to the ground. He did this, O my wretched soul, so that thou might be saved.


_Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit._

**To the Trinity:** Let us glorify the Father, let us exalt the Son and with faith let us worship the Divine and Holy Spirit, the Trinity undivided, Unity in Essence; Light of Lights, Life and Lives, giving light and life to the ends of the earth.

_Now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen._

**Theotokion:** Protect this, thy habitation, O Most-pure Mother of God, for through thee she reigns in faith, by thee she is made strong, by thee she is made victorious defeating every trial and temptation, despoiling every enemy and ruling over her obedient servants.


_Venerable Father Andrew, pray to God for us._

**To Saint Andrew:** O Venerable and Thrice-blessèd Father Andrew, the shepherd of Crete; cease not to offer thy prayers for us who sing thy praises; that we may be delivered from every danger and affliction, from corruption and sin, who honor thy memory with faith.

**Katavasia, Irmos 9:** Ineffable is the childbearing of a seedless conception; a mother remaining pure. For the birth of God renews nature’s birth; so in all ages we magnify thee in an Orthodox manner as the Mother and Bride of God.
