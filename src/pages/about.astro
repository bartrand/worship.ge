        <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          Worship.ge was founded by a small group of believers who wanted to create a space where
          people could encounter God authentically — through honest worship, faithful preaching,
          and genuine community.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
          We are a non-denominational, evangelical Christian congregation committed to the authority
          of Scripture and the love of Christ for all people.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What We Believe</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Our faith is summarised in a few core convictions.</p>
        <div class="cards">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>The Bible</h3>
            <p>We believe Scripture is the inspired, authoritative Word of God and our ultimate guide for faith and life.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
            <p>We believe Jesus is the Son of God, fully God and fully man, who died and rose again for our salvation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>The Gospel</h3>
            <p>Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone — not by works or human merit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>The Church</h3>
            <p>The local church is God's primary vehicle to make disciples and display his kingdom in the world.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>All People</h3>
            <p>Every person bears the image of God and is welcomed, loved, and invited into our community.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>We exist to worship God, grow in Christ, and bring his good news to our city and beyond.</p>
